<p>Shah Alam  is a city and the state capital of <strong> Petaling </strong>District and a small portion of the neighbouring Klang District. <em> Shah Alam replaced Kuala Lumpur</em> as the capital city of the state of Selangor in 1978 due to Kuala Lumpur's incorporation into a Federal Territory in 1974. Shah Alam was the first planned city in Malaysia after independence from Britain in 1957.</p>
